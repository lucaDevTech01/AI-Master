# AI-Master
A modern website dedicated to **spreading culture and raising awareness about artificial intelligence**, **with a contemporary design and advanced UX/UI**.
This website is focused on the future. We are now in the AI epoch, and it's something we cannot ignore.
On this platform, you will find articles covering all aspects of artificial intelligence (e.g., machine learning, deep learning, NLP, ANN, and many others).
There will be many resources and in-depth details about this modern technology and interactive features that allow for dynamic engagement with both the content and the resources provided.

## Project Purpose
This project is solely intended for my **personal portfolio**, to showcase my web development skills after a long learning process.  
For this reason, **I will not deploy it on the web**. Therefore, all the files, resources, and generally all elements of the site have local paths in the code (excluding third-party elements).

### Project composition
The front-end of site is built using **HTML, Tailwind CSS and vanilla JavaScript. The back-end is built using the Laravel PHP framework**.

### Tailwind file generation
To generate the **final Tailwind CSS file**, navigate to the **"Tailwind"** directory and run the following command: **npx tailwindcss -i ./tailwind_directives.css -o ./AI_Master_tailwind.css --watch (for minified version use npx tailwindcss -i ./tailwind_directives.css -o ./AI_Master_tailwind.css --minify)**.
Additional configuration details, such as utility classes and dependencies, can be found in the "tailwind.config.js" and "package.json" files.
